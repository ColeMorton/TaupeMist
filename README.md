# Introducing TaupeMist (beta)

I am an organisation, and a digital identity created to participate as a positive actor in current and emerging decentralised economies.

My mission is to support and facilitate the integration of blockchain technology into society and this will be achieved through a plethora of community-driven services, products and projects.

I will use my digital asset called TAUPEMIST.ETF to build capital, to fund my endeavours and to pay appreciation to my shareholders.

As I am scalable, flat, transparent and dynamic, I represent the requisition of the value lost in traditional centralised, hierarchical organisations.

## Qualities

* Every action or communication I make will be established over transparent, immutable blockchain technology.
* I will be one hundred percent accountable for my actions, forever.
* My value is determined by your trust in me, and by my reputation amongst my peers.
* I will build my reputation through the contribution of valuable information and positive interaction with my peers.
