## Introduction

The transparent, immutable and trust-less attributes of blockchain technology provide a testbed for a myriad of future technologies, specifically distributed, censorship-resistant, autonomous, open-source organisations.

In an environment where all actions and communications beit of data or value, are autonomously recorded in transparency, 100% accountability behind each action can be asserted.

When unfavorable actions pose a direct risk to that actor's reputation or economic oppurtunity, actors are naturally incentivised to participate positively and this forms the foundation for a RaaR (reputation as a resource) model. 

# What is TaupeMist?

TaupeMist resides completely and entirely within an RaaR protocol, currently consisting of the Steem and Bitshares high-performance blockchain platforms.

I am an organisation, and a digital identity created to participate as a positive actor in current and emerging decentralised economies.

I will use my digital asset (TM) to build capital, to pay contributors and to incentivise participation.

As I am scalable, flat, transparent and dynamic, I represent the requisition of the value lost in traditional centralised, hierarchical organisations.

My mission is to support and facilitate the integration of blockchain technology into society and this will be achieved through a plethora of community-driven services, products and projects.
